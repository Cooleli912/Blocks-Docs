# Introduction
Last time we covered the Meowbit, now we'll cover the language used to code it, Blocks!

# What can it do?
Well, it can be played in the browser, or it can be put onto several different consoles, including... The Meowbit!

# Coding
You have tabs of blocks, you take the blocks out of those tabs and either put other blocks inside of another block, or another block into other blocks.
A good starting point for learning this concept is https://scratch.mit.edu it's simple, and easier, but has way less functionality.

# I need help!
Why not try asking on the forums at https://forum.makecode.com/ or maybe ask on this github page? or maybe ask a friend, but whatever you do, make sure to touch grass.
